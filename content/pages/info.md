      i find beauty in the small moments—the way light spills onto a quiet
      street, the way shadows stretch in the afternoon, the way a song lingers
      in the air like a memory. designing and editing moodboards is how i bring
      my thoughts to life, blending images that feel like pieces of a dream.
      music is always playing in the background, setting the tone for my
      creativity. from the smooth melodies of seventeen and the hazy nostalgia
      of tv girl to the timeless elegance of ella fitzgerald and chet baker,
      every song becomes a soundtrack to my world.


      photography lets me capture the details that others might overlook—the
      softness of a passing glance, the flicker of neon on rainy pavement, the
      way jazz seems to hum in the stillness of the night. vintage aesthetics
      and film noir vibes inspire me, infusing my work with a sense of nostalgia
      and depth. whether through images, music, or the stories i tell in my art,
      i try to hold onto emotions, turning fleeting moments into something
      lasting.
