life has a way of moving forward even when you feel like standing still, of shifting beneath your feet before you even realize the ground is changing. it does not wait, does not pause for breath, does not soften its edges to make things easier. it pulls and stretches, carving itself into you in ways you never expected. sometimes it is gentle, like the warmth of sunlight through an open window, and other times it is relentless, pressing into you until you become something else entirely.

```
i have learned that life does not promise consistency. one moment, it is laughter echoing in the distance, the taste of something sweet on your tongue, the feeling of a hand in yours. the next, it is silence that lingers too long, a door that closes before you are ready. it is filled with things that slip through your fingers—conversations that never happen, moments you think will last forever but don’t, the quiet realization that nothing ever stays the same.
```

there are days when it feels light, where everything moves with an effortless rhythm, like the world is in sync with your heartbeat. but there are also days when it feels heavier, like something unseen is pressing into your shoulders, making every step just a little harder. you carry the weight of things unsaid, the burden of what you should have done, the pieces of yourself you have left behind in places you can’t return to.

the past lingers in the spaces between now and what comes next. it shows up in the scent of something familiar, in the way a song can transport you to a moment long gone, in the places you used to know that no longer feel the same. you try to move forward, but the past is always there, woven into your skin, stitched into your thoughts.

i have come to understand that life is made of contrasts—joy and sorrow, beginnings and endings, presence and absence. we chase after happiness as if it is something permanent, as if it is not just another fleeting moment in a long string of fleeting moments. we hold onto things too tightly, afraid of what it means to let go, afraid of what might happen if we open our hands and watch something slip away.

but maybe that is the way life is meant to be—something that is felt deeply, something that comes and goes, something that refuses to be held in place. we are not meant to stay unchanged. we are meant to shift, to break apart and come back together in new ways, to carry the echoes of where we have been while still making room for where we are going.

there is no certainty in this. no promise that everything will turn out the way we want it to. no guarantee that the things we love will stay. but there is movement, always movement. there is something waiting beyond the horizon, something unknown, something we have not yet touched. and maybe, just maybe, that is enough.
