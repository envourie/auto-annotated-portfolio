the taste of forgotten memories lingers like a bitter poison on the tongue—slow, creeping, and inescapable. they slip through your fingers like grains of sand, yet their absence carves a hollow ache deep within you. you remember just enough to crave them, to wish for them, to drown in the longing of what once was.

there was a time when those moments felt infinite, when laughter spilled into the air like golden light, when every touch carried warmth, and every glance held an unspoken understanding. but time is an unrelenting thief, snatching away the softness of the past and leaving behind only jagged edges. the things you once knew by heart begin to blur. the voices, the places, the faces—they fade like ink washed away by the rain. you try to hold on, but memory is fickle, slipping through your grasp no matter how tightly you cling to it.

and yet, you chase them. you chase them through sleepless nights, through quiet corners of old photographs, through the familiar scents that pull you back to places that no longer exist. you close your eyes and reach for the echoes, desperate to relive what time has stolen. but the past is cruel; it does not return. it only teases, offering fragments sharp enough to cut. a glimpse of a smile, a ghost of a voice, a fleeting sense of déjà vu that leaves you aching for something you can never touch again.

the poison spreads slowly, filling your veins with nostalgia too heavy to bear. it is not a sudden death, but a slow unraveling. every step forward is met with the pull of yesterday, a whisper of "what if" that drags you deeper into the abyss of longing. reality grows dull in comparison. the present moment feels empty, lacking the warmth, the color, the depth that once made life feel so full. the more you indulge in the memories, the more they consume you, turning your gaze backward until the future feels meaningless.

you tell yourself to move on, to let go, to accept that what’s gone will never return. but the truth is cruel—it is not the poison of forgotten memories that is killing you. it is the hunger for them, the desperate, aching wish that they could happen again. it is the longing for a yesterday that will never be today. and in that longing, you find yourself lost, trapped in the past, watching the present slip away like a dream you can no longer hold onto.
