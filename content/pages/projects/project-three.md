> "memories warm you up from the inside. but they also tear you apart." - Osamu Dazai

looking back at moments from my life always makes me feel nostalgic. school was a mix of fun and challenges—some days were full of laughter, while others felt really long. junior high was a time of change, making friends, learning new things, and dealing with schoolwork. there were fun times like school trips, group projects, and jokes with friends, but also hard times like studying for tests and keeping up with assignments. elementary school was much easier, with lots of playing, running around, and small adventures like class parties and storytelling during lunch.

kidzania was such a cool experience. pretending to be an adult, trying out different jobs, and feeling independent was exciting. i remember walking around, excited to try new activities and earn kidzania money, which felt so important back then. it was like a small version of the real world but way more fun and without stress.

photography is something i’ve loved for a long time. capturing little moments, interesting angles, and how light changes a scene is always fun for me. sometimes i take random pictures just because they make me happy. looking back at them feels like reliving a memory. photos tell stories without words, keeping emotions and details alive that might be forgotten. sometimes i take pictures just because they look nice, but other times, it’s about saving a feeling or moment that i never want to forget.
