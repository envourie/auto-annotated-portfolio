> "Memories warm you up from the inside. But they also tear you apart." - Osamu Dazai


looking back at moments from my life always brings a sense of nostalgia. school has been a mix of experiencesâ€”some days were filled with laughter, while others felt endless. junior high was a time of change, figuring things out, making friends, and dealing with academic pressure. there were fun moments like school trips, group projects, and inside jokes that still make me smile, but also challenges like exams and keeping up with responsibilities. 

kidzania was a unique experience, getting to pretend to be an adult, trying out different jobs, and feeling a sense of independence. i remember walking around, eager to try new activities, and earning kidzania currency that felt so important at the time. it was like stepping into a miniature version of the real world but with all the fun and none of the pressure.

photography is something that has stayed with me over the years. capturing small moments, interesting angles, and the way light transforms a scene has always fascinated me. sometimes i take random pictures just because they make me happy, and looking back at them feels like revisiting a memory. photos have a way of telling stories without words, preserving emotions and details that might otherwise fade. sometimes it's about aesthetics, but other times, it's about holding onto a feeling or a moment that I never want to forget.
