<div style="text-align: left">this is a compilation of my moodboards i made!! :3 some apps & webs that i use ; \***ibispaint x, canva, incollage, epik, vsco, adobe bg remover, pinterest, & photopea!** \*making moodboards is honestly so fun and relaxing for me. i love putting together different pictures, colors, and vibes to create something that matches my mood or aesthetic at the moment. sometimes i spend hours scrolling through pinterest, saving inspiration, and experimenting with different edits and layouts. some days everything just clicks, but other times i struggle to find the perfect combination. but that’s part of the fun!i also love trying out different styles, like soft pastels, dark grunge, y2k, or vintage vibes. it really depends on my mood. mixing and matching stickers, filters, and fonts makes everything feel more personal, and it’s so satisfying seeing the final result.sometimes i make moodboards inspired by my favorite songs, k-pop idols—especially seventeen—or just random things that make me happy. no matter what, i always have fun making them and expressing myself through all the little details.one of my biggest boosters when making moodboards is listening to my favs like *hers, tv girl, gorillaz, seventeen, mac demarco, and niki.* music always helps set the mood and makes the whole process even more enjoyable.</div>
